# FileSorter
A basic file sorting program using python.

Rev. 1: 
    This program sorts my downloads folder by file type. If a folder doesn't exist for the file type, it is created.
    This program also sorts my screenshots folder by the date created. If a folder for the particular day doesn't exist, it is created.

Rev. 2:
    Added I/O so user can choose file path to sort and which sorting method they would like to use.
